A full-featured, modern multi-role e-commerce platform built with Django. Farm2Market directly connects **farmers** with **buyers**, enabling streamlined product listings, cart management, order tracking, and logistics coordination — eliminating the need for middlemen.

##  Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- PostgreSQL / Supabase account (for production database)


##  Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd Farm2Market
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment
```bash
py -m venv my_env
# On Windows
my_env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source my_env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the directory containing `manage.py`:

```bash
cd Farm2Market
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Environment Configuration

Copy the example file and fill in your values:

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with the following variables:

```env
# Django Settings
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=True

# Database (leave unset to use local SQLite)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname

# Supabase S3 Media Storage
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=media
AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co/storage/v1/s3
AWS_S3_REGION_NAME=ap-southeast-1
```

> **Tip:** Leave `DATABASE_URL` unset to use a local SQLite database for development.

### 5. Configure Media Storage (Supabase S3)

Farm2Market uses **Supabase Storage (S3)** to handle user-uploaded product images.
- Create a **Public** bucket named `media` in your Supabase project.
- Inside the bucket, create a folder named `product_images`.
- Add your S3 Connection details to the `.env` file as shown above.

### 6. Database Migration
```bash
# First-time or after model changes:
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 7. Create Superuser
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 8. (Optional) Seed Admin Data

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` to:
- Add product `Category` entries (Vegetables, Fruits, Grains)
- Add `Logistic` providers (Pathao, Steadfast, Uber)

### 9. Run Development Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser.

##  Database Models

- **Profile** — Extends Django's `User` with a `role` (`farmer` or `buyer`). Farmers have `farm_name`, `farm_location`, and `bio`; buyers have a `delivery_address`.
- **Category** — Groups products into categories (e.g., Vegetables, Fruits, Grains). One-to-many with Products.
- **Product** — Listed by farmers with `name`, `price_per_unit`, `stock_quantity`, `unit`, and an optional `image`.
- **Cart / CartItem** — One persistent cart per buyer. Anonymous users get a session-based cart that merges on login.
- **Order / OrderItem** — Created per farmer on checkout with a price snapshot. Order status flow:

  ```
  PENDING
    ├── CONFIRMED → ASSIGNED → OUT_FOR_DELIVERY → DELIVERED → COMPLETED
    ├── REJECTED  (by farmer)
    └── CANCELLED (by buyer)
  ```

- **Logistic** — Delivery providers (e.g., Pathao, Steadfast) assigned by farmers at the `CONFIRMED` stage. Stores `name` and an optional `contact_number`.
- **Notification** — Per-user, per-order messages with an `is_read` flag, surfaced as navbar badges via context processors.


##  Admin Features

- **Django Admin Panel** - Full CRUD operations on all models
- **Category Management** - Create and organize product categories
- **Product Management** - Add and manage farmer products with images
- **Order Management** - View and update order statuses
- **User Management** - Manage farmer and buyer accounts
- **Logistic Management** - Add and configure delivery providers
- **Stock Control** - Monitor and update product inventory


##  Security Features

- CSRF protection on all forms
- Password validation and hashing via Django's auth system
- Login-required decorators on all protected views
- Role-based access control (farmers cannot access buyer views and vice versa)
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration data
- Session security for anonymous cart management


##  Deployment

### Environment Variables Reference

| Variable       | Required | Description                                         |
|----------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `SECRET_KEY`   | Yes      | Django secret key for cryptographic signing         |
| `DEBUG`        | No       | `True` for development, `False` for production      |
| `DATABASE_URL` | No       | PostgreSQL connection string; defaults to SQLite    |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Yes | Supabase S3 Access Key for image uploads            |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Yes | Supabase S3 Secret Key                          |
| `AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME`| Yes | Target S3 bucket (e.g. `media`)                |
| `AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL` | Yes | Supabase S3 Endpoint URL                          |

The project uses `dj-database-url` with a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, making it straightforward to deploy on platforms like **Render**, **Railway**, or **Heroku** with a Supabase PostgreSQL database.
